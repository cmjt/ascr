The ascr package
----------------

The `ascr` ("acoustic spatial capture-recapture") package provides
software implementation for the fitting of spatial capture-recapture
models for acoustic data.

This manual details a user interface which may be used to fit these
models. This application was developed in partnership with IUCN SSC
primate specialist group section on small apes.
